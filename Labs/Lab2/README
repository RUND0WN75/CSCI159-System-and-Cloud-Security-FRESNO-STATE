Description: you classify users to 4 levels (public, limited, secret, top secret). You have 50 files on the
disk, whose security level is also classified randomly. Then, you assign the security level of each file
according to the same level. When a user login, you can show only those files that he/she has access
to. You should use an appropriate model for your application.
